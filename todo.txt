Server:
  -D Timer. Day-interval and time on and time off (per channel)
  -D Master on/off per channel (is channel active or not basically)
  -D Override on/off per channel (but keep timer)
  - "Run once" per channel, until next off
  -D Thread-safeify callbacks, mutex on channel/gpio access?
  - GET for master, run-once, override
  -D Register callbacks for state changes (i.e. app wants to get a callback)

App:
  -D GUI (qml?)
  -D Rest client (cpprestsdk)
  - Find IP automatically somehow? If we know port?
  -D Make a client abstraction, easier and nicer to handle communication
  - Know what state is illegal (i.e. setting override when master is off)
  - Set actual timer

Bugs:
  -D Exception that isn't handled if app is started and server is not running
  - Error handling, i.e. what if setting up subscription fails? Or if setting state fails
